### **Traditional vs. Smart Escrows**

Escrows have long been a cornerstone of secure transactions, but traditional systems are plagued by inefficiencies like high costs, slow settlements, and reliance on intermediaries.

Trustless Work introduces **smart escrows**, leveraging blockchain technology to modernize and simplify this essential process. Here’s how we compare:

| Feature             | Traditional Escrows                            | Trustless Work (Smart Escrows)                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intermediaries**  | Requires banks, lawyers, or third parties.     | No intermediaries—fully automated with smart contracts.         |
| **Fees**            | High due to middleman involvement.             | Minimal, with no unnecessary overhead.                          |
| **Settlement Time** | Slow, often taking days or weeks.              | Fast, with instant or near-instant settlements.                 |
| **Transparency**    | Limited; users rely on intermediary reporting. | Fully transparent; every step is on-chain and verifiable.       |
| **Scalability**     | Difficult to scale due to manual processes.    | Scales effortlessly with API-driven automation.                 |
| **Access**          | Restricted to large transactions due to cost.  | Accessible for all transaction sizes.                           |
| **Complexity**      | Burdensome paperwork and manual management.    | Simplified, streamlined workflows for developers and platforms. |
